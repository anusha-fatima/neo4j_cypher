This is an acompanying repository to the talk given at [Karchi AI's](https://karachidotai.com) Ramadan Skill series and contains code and exercise related to Neo4j and Cypher Query language.


## Organization of Repository
The repository contains two main folders one for cypher querying and second for shortest path. The structure and use cases are as follows:

 -- cypher_query
|---  create_network (Contains cypher query for creating sample employee network 
|--- sample_queries (Contains sample cypher queries for the employee network)

-- shortest_path_algo
|--- create_network (Contains cypher query for creating sample network for shortest path algo)
|--- algo (Contains algo code for Delta-Stepping Single-Source Shortest Path)
